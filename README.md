# Sales Data Analysis
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project was developed as part of the **Data Analyst Certification** on DataCamp. It involves **data cleaning, analysis, and visualization** using Python and Jupyter Notebook. Additionally, a **Power BI dashboard** was created to present key insights.  

The dataset used in this project is **fictional** and represents sales data from a company called **"Pens & Printers"**, which sells office supplies. The analysis focuses on **the performance of different sales methods** to identify trends and optimize sales strategies.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies  
- **Python** (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Power BI**

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights  
- The **Email + Call** method outperforms all other methods by a significant margin, showing the highest overall revenue per customer.  
- On the other hand, the **Call** method demonstrates notably low revenue per customer, suggesting it is inefficient. Given that this method requires significantly more time investment, it is recommended to discontinue its use.  
- An increase in the number of **site visits** correlates with higher revenue across all sales methods, emphasizing the importance of driving more frequent visits to the site to boost overall revenue.
